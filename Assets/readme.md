# Innoactive Training Module Examples

The Innoactive Training Module Examples is the Unity project of a complete training application that was built with the Innoactive Training Template. It features a range of example courses highlighting different features through simple interactions in VR. You can edit the training courses or create new ones and select them from the inspector of the `[TRAINING_CONFIGURATION]` game object that is present in every training scene.

An overview of the example courses provided can be found [here](http://developers.innoactive.de/documentation/training-module/latest/) as `Example Project` in the articles section.
